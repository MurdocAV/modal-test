Quick test of using Modal's

Mainly to teach myself Css and JS used in creating one. I used it for a project for creating an audio engineers portfolio of album.

The modals were used to zoom in on the page and highlight the album name and tracks once clicked. I also used Spotify's API to get the tracks and display them for the client.

22 July 2019: I don't like modals anymore.
